In this scenario, the goal is to convert to a VLAN-aware bridge in vlan200, with the link to server01 tagged, and thel ink to server02 untagged.

On leaf01, swp1 is configured to be tagged in VLAN 200 correctly:

auto swp1
iface swp1
 bridge-vids 200

However, a VLAN sub-interface co-exists that would overlap with the bridge, and this would need to be removed:


auto swp1.200
iface swp1.200

The bond-xlink should only be a trunk in the bridge, and the sub-interface in bridge-ports in a vlan-aware bridge is invalid, and also shouldn't exist in the configuration:

auto bridge
iface bridge
 bridge-ports swp1 bond-xlink.200
 bridge-vlan-aware yes
 bridge-pvid 1

auto bond-xlink.200
iface bond-xlink.200

The relevant configuration should look like the following:

auto bond-xlink
iface bond-xlink
    bond-slaves swp49 swp50

auto bridge
iface bridge
    bridge-ports bond-xlink swp1
    bridge-pvid 1
    bridge-vids 1-200
    bridge-vlan-aware yes

auto swp1
iface swp1
    bridge-vids 200

This could be configuration manually in /etc/network/interfaces followed by 'ifreload -a', or with the following net commands followed by a 'net commit':


 net del interface bond-xlink.200
 net del interface swp1.200
 net add bridge bridge ports bond-xlink
 net add bridge bridge vids 1-200

-----


On leaf02, there are similar issues.  swp2 should be untagged, but it is left as default tagging all VLANs in the bridge:

auto swp2
iface swp2

auto bond-xlink.200
iface bond-xlink.200

auto bridge
iface bridge
 bridge-ports swp2 bond-xlink.200
 bridge-vlan-aware yes
 bridge-pvid 1

And the bond-xlink sub-interface shouldn't exist and only the parent bond interface should be in the bridge.  This need to be corrected to look like the following manually or through NCLU:

auto swp2
iface swp2
 bridge-access 200

auto swp49
iface swp49

auto swp50
iface swp50

auto bond-xlink
iface bond-xlink
 bond-slaves swp49 swp50

auto bridge
iface bridge
 bridge-ports swp2 bond-xlink
 bridge-vlan-aware yes
 bridge-pvid 1
 bridge-vids 1-200

After making these changes, pings between the servers should be successful:

cumulus@server02:~$ ping 192.168.200.10
